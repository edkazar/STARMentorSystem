This are the required includes for the Mentor system to work properly.

Property sheets for the system are also provided. Include the property sheets in the VS project and install the libraries in a way that they match the way the property sheet specify the paths.

Future work includes to create a tutorial to easily migrate the Mentor System. Until then, the easiest way to set the Mentor System is by following the property sheets.
